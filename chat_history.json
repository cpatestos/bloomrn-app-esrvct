You want me to help you plan the BloomRN app, a React Native + Expo app designed to support both Student Nurses and Registered Nurses. The app will have onboarding, role-specific content, a daily check-in feature, and several tabs to promote well-being and professional development. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   Onboarding Flow: Implement the onboarding process with role selection (\"Student Nurse\" or \"RN\"), profile fields specific to each role, and priority selection. Store this data locally.\n-   Bottom Tab Navigation: Set up the bottom tab navigation with five tabs: Home, Bloom Care, Work/Study (with role-specific labels), Reflect, and Resources.\n-   Daily Check-In: Create the Daily Check-In feature with mood, stress, energy levels, optional notes, and gratitude items. Display role-specific self-care suggestions and affirmations after submission.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   Colors:\n    -   Background: `#F0F8FF` (AliceBlue)\n    -   Text: `#2F4F4F` (DarkSlateGray)\n    -   TextSecondary: `#696969` (DimGray)\n    -   Primary: `#ADD8E6` (LightBlue)\n    -   Secondary: `#90EE90` (LightGreen)\n    -   Accent: `#F5DEB3` (Wheat)\n    -   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    -   Highlight: `#E0FFFF` (LightCyan)\n-   Typography: Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel or \"Roboto\" for broader compatibility.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these features.\n\n**Plan for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is set up with React Native and Expo. Verify that the necessary packages (e.g., `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`, `react-native-paper`, `AsyncStorage`) are installed.\n2.  **File Structure:** Organize the project into a clear file structure, including `screens`, `components`, `navigation`, and `data`.\n3.  **Onboarding Screen:** Create the onboarding screen with role selection, profile fields, and priority selection. Use `AsyncStorage` to store the user's role, profile information, and preferences locally.\n4.  **Bottom Tab Navigation:** Implement the bottom tab navigation using `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`. Create placeholder screens for each tab (Home, Bloom Care, Work/Study, Reflect, Resources).\n5.  **Daily Check-In Component:** Develop the Daily Check-In component with input fields for date, mood, stress, energy, optional notes, and gratitude items. Store the entries locally using `AsyncStorage`.\n6.  **Home Tab Content:** Populate the Home tab with a summary of the day's check-in, self-care suggestions, and affirmations based on the user's role.\n7.  **Bloom Care Tab:** Create the basic structure for the Bloom Care tab, including category and duration filters.\n8.  **Work/Study Tab:** Implement the basic layout for the Work/Study tab, with role-specific content (weekly planner for students, shift logging for RNs).\n9.  **Reflect Tab:** Set up the Reflect tab with role-specific entry fields (Barriers to Success for students, Challenges for RNs), a gratitude list, and journal entries.\n10. **Resources Tab:** Create a hard-coded list of resource cards with titles, descriptions, and link actions.\n\nFinally, remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-30T12:39:58.850950"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the BloomRN app!
